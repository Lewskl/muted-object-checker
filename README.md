# Muted Object Checker

A simple tool to check .osu files for muted objects, based on volume or sampleset.

Core functionality is based on [QuiescentRabbitt's similar project](https://github.com/QuiescentRabbitt/osu-silent-circle-checker), with some added functionality and QoL improvments, like an improved UI and the ability to ignore minor unsnaps.

Just download the "muted.jar" file and run it, if you don't feel like compiling the project yourself.

## Known Issues

*Spinners get detected as circles, so be aware of possible false-positives
*Can't detect muted repeats/sliderends
*???
